== Description ==

Blocksy is a blazing fast and lightweight WordPress theme built with the latest web technologies. It was built with the Gutenberg editor in mind and has a lot of options that makes it extendable and customizable. You can easily create any type of website, such as business agency, shop, corporate, education, restaurant, blog, portfolio, landing page and so on. It works like a charm with popular WordPress page builders, including Elementor, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer and Brizy. Since it is responsive and adaptive, translation ready, SEO optimized and has WooCommerce built-in, you will experience an easy build and even an increase in conversions.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Type in Blocksy in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Build Instructions ==

This theme contains some JavaScript files that need a compilation step in
order to be consumable by the browsers. The compilation is done by the
[`build-process`](https://github.com/creative-Themes/build-process) package
(which is just a preset config over WebPack). We do plan to eventually migrate
over to [`wp-scripts`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/scripts)
as the build pipeline.

So, in order to build the theme files, you need to execute these commands:

1. `npm install` or `yarn install`, both work just fine.
2. `npm run build` -- for a production build, or `npm run dev` for developments builds, which include a proper file watcher
3. The final files will be included in `admin/dashboard/static/bundle` and `static/bundle` directories.

The repeated `BlocksyReact`, `BlocksyReactDOM` and `wp.element` got enqueued
that way for two reasons:

1. We started to use React Hooks in WordPress 5.1, and we needed an actual
version of `wp.element` for that. A version of `wp.element` with hooks got
shipped only with WordPress 5.2. We planned on getting rid of our global version as
soon as 5.2 got released, but now I see a problem with backwards
compatibility.
2. We need to use a global version of React and ReactDOM because we have some
components using hooks both in the theme an din the `blocksy-companion` plugin
(https://creativethemes.com/downloads/blocksy-companion.zip). That way we
avoid breaking the rules of hooks.
