= How to use it on ajax load more? =

If your theme follow wordpress 'post-load' event with `document` then you don't have to do anything.
Here is the details about it: https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins#The_post-load_JavaScript_Event

But if you don't then just call this javascript function on ajax load event
```
$('.variations_form').each(function(){
    $(this).wc_variation_form();
});
```
And your are ready to go.
